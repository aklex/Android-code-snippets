    <string name="mascot">The mascot of Android is a green android robot, as related to the software\'s name.
        Although it has no official name, the Android team at Google reportedly call it "Bugdroid".[245] Due to Android\'s high popularity in the 2010s, it has become one of the most recognizable icons in the technology world.

It was designed by then-Google graphic designer Irina Blok on November 5, 2007 when Android was announced. Contrary to reports that she was tasked with a project to create an icon,[246] Blok confirmed in an interview that she independently developed it and made it open source. The robot design was initially not presented to Google, but it quickly became commonplace in the Android development team, with various different variations of it created by the developers there who liked the figure, as it was free under a Creative Commons license.[247][248] Its popularity amongst the development team eventually led to Google adopting it as an official icon as part of the Android logo when it launched to consumers in 2008.

Since then the robot figure has had plenty of other variations created.</string>
